# odin-recursion

This mini-project involved implementing knowledge of recursion.

- assignment 1 involved finding n fibonacci numbers using both an iterative approach as well as a recursive method
- assignment 2 involved sorting a given array using the merge sort algorithm. Previous lessons taught about the concept of recursion, merging two sorted arrays, and the concept behind merge sort algorithm
  These assignments also helped in learning about the time complexities of these methods, memory allocation in call stack for recursive functions
